HTML is the basic building block of the webs. Often people call it a programming language but what it is basically is a markup language. While a lot of it sounds confusing to first time users, in simple words HTML
determines the structure of a web page. It uses various tags to tell the browser what we actually want to see on the web page.Now where can you write a HTML code? It's simple again. You can use
your notepad for it, however to see it on the web browser, instead of keeping the “.txt” extension, you can change it “.html” and boom you can see your code lit up on the browser after clicking it.
Now let’s create a cheatsheet for you to remember the basic tags.
1. <!DOCTYPE html> : This defines the document type and is basically
not an HTML tag. While many tags need to be closed, this does not
require so and is complete in itself. At the beginning many of us don’t
use it, but if you use an IDE like brackets like I do, you can find this in
the setup.
2. <html>.....</html>: This tag holds your entire html document/code
together and is the root of the html document.
3. <head></head> :The head tag consists of metadata and comes
between the html tag and the body tag. Metadata means document
title,character sets and link to stylesheets.
4. <title></title>: Consists of the title of the webpage.
5. <body></body>: One of the most important tags. This includes all of
your document body.Note: There can be only one body in the HTML
document.
6. <h1></h1>: This defines the importance of HTML headings or their
size. There is a whole range like h2,h3,h4,h5,h6. h1 is the most
important while h6 is the least.
7. <p></p>: Adding a paragraph
8. <!--...-->: Adding a comment
9.<a href=""> : for adding a hyperlink
10.<div></div> :	Defines a section in a document. This is a very important tag for seperating different parts of your documentation.
11.<img src="...">: Adding an image (src here stands for the source file destination)
12.<header></header>: Contains the heading of the document.
These are some of the beginner tags that will help you to build a html page.
